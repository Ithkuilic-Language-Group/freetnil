* Design Goals
Goals for the language (in no particular order and subject to community review):
- expressiveness,
- unambiguity,
- semantic productivity,
- density,
- detail.

Additionally this project is an experiment in computer-aided language development, with a twist.
Alongside the usual tables of affixes and category values, these documents will contain programs for encoding and deciphering its text. 
* Description of the Language
Like other Philosophical/Ithkuilic languages, Free TNIL consists of a number of abstract categories marked morphologically on specific word-types.
[[file:docs/categories.org][This document]] outlines the categories of the language.
A morphology document is forthcoming
