* The Free TNIL Project
A community driven conlang inspired by [[http://ithkuil.net/][John Quijada's Ithkuil]].
* Design Goals
Goals for the language (in no particular order and subject to community review):
- expressiveness,
- unambiguity,
- semantic productivity,
- detail.
* Description of the Language
Like other Philosophical/Ithkuilic languages, Free TNIL consists of a number of abstract categories marked morphologically on specific word-types.
[[file:categories.org][This document]] outlines the categories of the language.
A morphology document is forthcoming
