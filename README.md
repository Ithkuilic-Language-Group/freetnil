# The Free TNIL Project
_Free TNIL_ is the working title of a community driven conlang inspired by [John
Quijada's Ithkuil](http://ithkuil.net). It includes a refactoring of the
morphological system developed by Mr. Quijada, and incorporates ideas from
category theory and frame semantics.

## Design Goals
Engineering choices about Free TNIL will be made in accordance with the
principles laid out in [this document.](./design-goals.md)

Goals for the language (in no particular order and subject to community review):
- expressiveness,
- unambiguity,
- composability,
- clear semantics,
- separation of concerns,
- parsimony.

## Description of the project
Like other Philosophical/Ithkuilic languages, Free TNIL consists of a number of
abstract categories marked morphologically on specific word-types.  [This
document](./docs/md/categories.md) outlines the categories of the language.
Morphology awaits the completion of the categories document.

This project is an experiment in computer-aided language development, with a
twist.  In addition to the usual tables of affixes and category values, these
documents will contain programs for encoding and deciphering its text.  The end
goal of this project is not only the specification of a language, but also an
implementation of it.

Contributions and bug-fixes are welcome, and anybody may contribute.  [See here
