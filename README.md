Design Goals
============

Goals for the language (in no particular order and subject to community
review):

-   expressiveness,
-   unambiguity,
-   semantic productivity,
-   detail.

Description of the Language
===========================

Like other Philosophical/Ithkuilic languages, Free TNIL consists of a
number of abstract categories marked morphologically on specific
word-types. [This document](categories.org) outlines the categories of
the language. A morphology document is forthcoming
