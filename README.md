The Free TNIL Project
=====================

Free TNIL is the working title of a community driven conlang inspired by
[John Quijada\'s Ithkuil](http://ithkuil.net/). It includes a
refactoring of the category system developed by Mr. Quijada.

Design Goals
============

Goals for the language (in no particular order and subject to community
review):

-   expressiveness,
-   unambiguity,
-   semantic productivity,
-   density,
-   detail.

Additionally this project is an experiment in computer-aided language
development, with a twist. Alongside the usual tables of affixes and
category values, these documents will contain programs for encoding and
deciphering its text.

Description of the Language
===========================

Like other Philosophical/Ithkuilic languages, Free TNIL consists of a
number of abstract categories marked morphologically on specific
word-types. [This document](docs/categories.org) outlines the categories
of the language. A morphology document is forthcoming
