#+title: Free TNIL Categories
* Morphological Categories
Words in Free TNIL inflect for many categories. This document enumerates those categories and their values.

** Lexical items
Each root has three stems and...

| Value   | Description                     |
|---------+---------------------------------|
| Content | material, interiority           |
| Form    | shape, exteriority              |
| Process | activity, effort                |
| Result  | intent                          |


** Organizational Categories
The "Organizational set" is a powerful way of expressing how a concept is instantiated in space and time.
It expresses:
- how many instances,
- their perceptible similarity or diversity,
- their functional relations,
- their physical proximity or involvement with with one another,
- the vagueness of the criteria by which they're categorized,
- 

|  3 | numbers         |
|  3 | connectednesses |
|  2 | compositions    |
|  4 | dispostitions   |
| 12 | envelopes       |
|  2 | quantifications |
|  2 | vaguenesses     |

For [Number, Connectedness, Composition], there are 1 (Singular) + 6 other combinations.
The 12 envelopes come in 2 series of six distinguished by whether they refer to space or time.
7*4*12*2*2=1344 values.

| homogeneous   | dual | plural |
|---------------+------+--------|
| isolated      |      | tn     |
| contiguous    |      | t      |
| fused         |      | k      |
|---------------+------+--------|
| heterogeneous | dual | plural |
|---------------+------+--------|
| isolated      |      | pf     |
| contiguous    |      | ts     |
| fused         |      | kx     |

*** Number
Number communicates how many instances of a stem are involved in the sentence's action.
| Value       | Definition                     |
|-------------+--------------------------------|
| Singular    | individual                     |
| Dual        | pair                           |
| Plural      | group                          |
*** Connectedness
Connectedness describes the spatiotemporal proximity of the items named by the stem.
| Value      | Definition         |
|------------+--------------------|
| Isolated   | separate           |
| Contiguous | adjacent, touching |
| Fused      | attached, combined |
*** Disposition
`Disposition conveys the similarities of use, purpose, or condition
among members of a set.
| Name         | Definition                     |
|--------------+--------------------------------|
| Ambivalent   | unknown/irrelevant use/purpose |
| Oppositional | divided/conflicted use/purpose |
| Mutual       | shared use/purpose             |
| Synergetic   | emergent use/purpose           |
*** Composition
Composition describes the similarity or variety of a set.
| Name          | Definition        |
|---------------+-------------------|
| Homogeneous   | uniform members   |
| Heterogeneous | diverse members   |

*** Distribution
Distribution governs whether operations are applied to individual items from a set or the set itself.
Another way to think about Distribution: Conjunctive Distribution /singularizes/ the set.
| Value       | Definition               |
|-------------+--------------------------|
| Disjunctive | each instance separately |
| Conjunctive | all instances together   |

*** Envelope
Envelope identifies the spatiotemporal limits and dynamics of the set.

Note: I have Envelope scope outside of distribution.
Thus, by varying Distribution, we can refer to the beginning of the set, or the beginning of each member of the set.

| Value      | space                                    | time                     |

| Holistic   | all                                      | (whole) duration of...   |
| Initial    | (spatial) beginning, first in a sequence | (beginning) beginning    |
| Terminal   | (spatial) end, last in a sequence        | (temporal) end           |
| Augmentive | physical/directional increase            | developing/becoming      |
| Diminutive | physical/directional decrease            | decaying/ceasing-to-be   |

| Non-Vague | clear set membership                                             |

** Telicity
Telicity differentiates between goal- and process-driven verbs.
| Value  | Definition                             |
