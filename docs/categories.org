Words in Free TNIL inflect for many categories. This document enumerates those categories and their values.
** Lexical items
Each root has three stems and...

** Organizational Categories
The "Organizational set" is a powerful way of expressing how a concept is instantiated in space and time.
It expresses:
- how many instances,
- their perceptible similarity or diversity,
- their functional relations,
- their physical proximity or involvement with with one another,
-

*** Number
Number communicates how many instances of a stem are involved in the sentence's action.
| Value       | Definition                     |
|-------------+--------------------------------|
| Singular    | individual                     |
| Dual        | pair                           |
| Plural      | group                          |
*** Connectedness
Connectedness describes the spatiotemporal proximity of the items named by the stem.
| Value      | Definition         |
|------------+--------------------|
| Isolated   | separate           |
| Contiguous | adjacent, touching |
| Fused      | attached, combined |
*** Disposition
Disposition conveys the similarities of use, purpose, or condition
among members of a set.
| Name         | Definition                     |
|--------------+--------------------------------|
| Ambivalent   | unknown/irrelevant use/purpose |
| Oppositional | divided/conflicted use/purpose |
| Mutual       | shared use/purpose             |
| Synergetic   | emergent use/purpose           |
*** Composition
Composition describes the similarity or variety of a set.
| Name          | Definition        |
|---------------+-------------------|
| Homogeneous   | uniform members   |
| Heterogeneous | diverse members   |

*** Distribution
Distribution governs whether operations are applied to individual items from a set or the set itself.
Another way to think about Distribution: Conjunctive Distribution /singularizes/ the set.
| Value       | Definition               |
|-------------+--------------------------|
| Disjunctive | each instance separately |
| Conjunctive | all instances together   |

*** Envelope
Envelope identifies the spatiotemporal limits and dynamics of the set.

Note: I have Envelope scope outside of distribution.
Thus, by varying Distribution, we can refer to the beginning of the set, or the beginning of each member of the set.
| Value      | Definition             |
|------------+------------------------|
| Partial    | part                   |
| Holistic   | all                    |
| Initial    | beginning              |
| Terminal   | end                    |
| Augmentive | developing/becoming    |
| Diminutive | decaying/ceasing-to-be |

*** Quantification

| Value       | Definition                      |
|-------------+---------------------------------|
| Existential | "there exists...", at least one |
| Universal   | every instance                  |

*** Vagueness
| Value     | Definition                                                       |
|-----------+------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Vague     | "something like", "what passes for"; questionable set membership |
| Non-Vague | clear set membership                                             |

** Telicity
Telicity differentiates between goal- and process-driven verbs.
| Value  | Definition                             |
|--------+----------------------------------------|
| Telic  | goal-driven, completable action        |
| Atelic | process-driven, non-completable action |
** Comparison
