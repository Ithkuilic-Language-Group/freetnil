#+title: Free TNIL Categories
* Morphological Categories
Words in Free TNIL inflect for many categories. This document enumerates those categories and their values.

** Lexical items
Each root has three stems and...

| Value   | Description                     |
|---------+---------------------------------|
| Content | material, interiority           |
| Form    | shape, exteriority              |
| Process | activity, effort                |
| Result  | intent                          |


** Organizational Categories
The "Organizational set" is a powerful way of expressing how a concept is instantiated in space and time.
The organizational set is represented morphologically by a consonantal affix.
| Category       | Values | Question                                                                 |
|----------------+--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Number         |      3 | How many items in the set?                                               |
| Connectedness  |      3 | How closely are the items arranged?                                      |
| Composition    |      2 | Are the items physically similar?                                        |
| Dispostition   |      4 | What is the use/purpose/intent of the items with respect to one another? |
| Distribution   |      2 | Is the set as a whole being discussed, or each member separately?        |
| Envelope       |     12 | What part of the set (or its members) is under consideration?            |
| Quantification |      2 | Is the speaker making an existential universal claim?                    |
| Vagueness      |      2 | Is the main term being used strictly or not?                             |


Number, connectedness, and composition are tightly coupled with one another.
The categories of connectedness and composition cannot apply to Singular sets.
Consequently, for there are seven valid combinations of Number, Connectedness, Composition.

The 12 envelopes come in 2 series of six distinguished by whether they refer to space or time.
7*4*12*2*2*2=1344 values.

*** Number
Number communicates how many instances of a stem are involved in the sentence's action.
| Value       | Definition                     |
|-------------+--------------------------------|
| Singular    | individual                     |
| Dual        | pair                           |
| Plural      | group                          |
*** Connectedness
Connectedness describes the spatiotemporal proximity of the items named by the stem.
| Value      | Definition         |
|------------+--------------------|
| Isolated   | separate           |
| Contiguous | adjacent, touching |
| Fused      | attached, combined |
*** Disposition
Disposition conveys the similarities of use, purpose, or condition
among members of a set.
| Name         | Definition                     |
|--------------+--------------------------------|
| Ambivalent   | unknown/irrelevant use/purpose |
| Oppositional | divided/conflicted use/purpose |
| Mutual       | shared use/purpose             |
| Synergetic   | emergent use/purpose           |
*** Composition
Composition describes the similarity or variety of a set.
| Name          | Definition        |
|---------------+-------------------|
| Homogeneous   | uniform members   |
| Heterogeneous | diverse members   |

*** Distribution
Distribution governs whether operations are applied to individual items from a set or the set itself.
Another way to think about Distribution: Conjunctive Distribution /singularizes/ the set.
| Value       | Definition               |
|-------------+--------------------------|
| Disjunctive | each instance separately |
| Conjunctive | all instances together   |

*** Envelope
Envelope identifies the spatiotemporal limits and dynamics of the set.

Note: I have Envelope scope outside of distribution.
Thus, by varying Distribution, we can refer to the beginning of the set, or the beginning of each member of the set.

| Value      | space                                    | time                     |

| Holistic   | all                                      | (whole) duration of...   |
| Initial    | (spatial) beginning, first in a sequence | (beginning) beginning    |
| Terminal   | (spatial) end, last in a sequence        | (temporal) end           |
| Augmentive | physical/directional increase            | developing/becoming      |

| Non-Vague | clear set membership                                             |

** Telicity
