#+title: Free TNIL Categories

* Morphological Categories
Words in Free TNIL inflect for many categories. This document enumerates those categories and their values.

** Lexical items
Each root has three stems and...

| Value   | Description                     |
|---------+---------------------------------|
| Content | material, interiority           |
| Form    | shape, exteriority              |
| Process | activity, effort                |

| Result  | intent                          |

** Organizational Categories
The "Organizational set" is a powerful way of expressing how a concept is instantiated in space and time.
The organizational set is represented morphologically by a consonantal affix.
| Category       | Values | Question                                                                 |
|----------------+--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Number         |      3 | How many items in the set?                                               |
| Connectedness  |      3 | How closely are the items arranged?                                      |
| Composition    |      2 | Are the items physically similar?                                        |
| Dispostition   |      4 | What is the use/purpose/intent of the items with respect to one another? |
| Distribution   |      2 | Is the set as a whole being discussed, or each member separately?        |
| Envelope       |     12 | What part of the set (or its members) is under consideration?            |
| Quantification |      2 | Is the speaker making an existential universal claim?                    |

| Vagueness      |      2 | Is the main term being used strictly or not?                             |

Number, connectedness, and composition are tightly coupled with one another.
The categories of connectedness and composition cannot apply to Singular sets.
Consequently, for there are seven valid combinations of Number, Connectedness, Composition.

The 12 envelopes come in 2 series of six distinguished by whether they refer to space or time.
7*4*12*2*2*2=1344 values.

*** Number
Number communicates how many instances of a stem are involved in the sentence's action.
| Value       | Definition                     |
|-------------+--------------------------------|
| Singular    | individual                     |
| Dual        | pair                           |
| Plural      | group                          |
*** Connectedness
Connectedness describes the spatiotemporal proximity of the items named by the stem.
| Value      | Definition         |
|------------+--------------------|
| Isolated   | separate           |
| Contiguous | adjacent, touching |
| Fused      | attached, combined |
*** Disposition
Disposition conveys the similarities of use, purpose, or condition
among members of a set.
| Name         | Definition                     |
|--------------+--------------------------------|
| Ambivalent   | unknown/irrelevant use/purpose |
| Oppositional | divided/conflicted use/purpose |
| Mutual       | shared use/purpose             |
| Synergetic   | emergent use/purpose           |
*** Composition
Composition describes the similarity or variety of a set.
| Name          | Definition        |
|---------------+-------------------|
| Homogeneous   | uniform members   |
| Heterogeneous | diverse members   |

*** Distribution
Distribution governs whether operations are applied to individual items from a set or the set itself.
Another way to think about Distribution: Conjunctive Distribution /singularizes/ the set.
| Value       | Definition               |
|-------------+--------------------------|
| Disjunctive | each instance separately |
| Conjunctive | all instances together   |

*** Envelope
Envelope identifies the spatiotemporal limits and dynamics of the set.
Note: I have Envelope scope outside of distribution.
Thus, by varying Distribution, we can refer to the beginning of the set, or the beginning of each member of the set.

| Value      | space                                    | time                     |

| Holistic   | all                                      | (whole) duration of...   |
| Initial    | (spatial) beginning, first in a sequence | (beginning) beginning    |
| Terminal   | (spatial) end, last in a sequence        | (temporal) end           |
| Augmentive | physical/directional increase            | developing/becoming      |
| Diminutive | physical/directional decrease            | decaying/ceasing-to-be   |

| Universal   | every instance                  |

*** Vagueness
| Value     | Definition                                                       |
|-----------+------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Vague     | "something like", "what passes for"; questionable set membership |
| Non-Vague | clear set membership                                             |

** Telicity
Telicity differentiates between goal- and process-driven verbs.
| Value  | Definition                             |
|--------+----------------------------------------|
| Telic  | goal-driven, completable action        |

** Comparison
| Name | Definition |
|------+------------|

** Domain
Domain selects the context in which the word is deployed.
| Value         | Definition            |
|---------------+-----------------------|
| Material      | objective             |
| Social        | cultural/personal     |
| Metaphorical  | analogical/rhetorical |
| Philosophical | gestalt               |
*** Material
The Material Domain refers to physical reality of sensible objects.
*** Social
The Social Domain draws attention to the social or cultural dimensions of the subject of discussion.
*** Metaphorical
The Metaphorical Domain considers the analogical, rhetorical, or significative use of a word, rather than its literal definition.
*** Philosophical
The Philosophical Domain considers the full historical and philosophical range of meanings of a word.

** Evidentials
Evidentials mark the source of information presented in an utterance.

| Name             | Gloss                                   | Description                                                            |
|------------------+-----------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Credential       | "I believe/assume/posit/hypothesize..." | belief with unspecified evidence                                       |
| Observational    | "I observe..."                          | present sensory knowledge                                              |
| Recollective     | "I remember..."                         | past sensory knowledge                                                 |
| Reportive        | "Someone informed me..."                | 2nd-hand knowledge/hearsay from specific informants                    |
| Conventional     | "I know through cultural means..."      | general cultural knowledge                                             |
| Inferential      | "I conclude..."                         | result of rational process (however informal)                          |
| Analogical       | "I analogize..."                        | result of comparison, induction, or ostension                          |
| Non-Apprehensive | "I know by negative means..."           | conclusion from absence of evidence, failure/absurdity of alternatives |
| Imaginary        | [non-claim: unreal]                     | statement not thought to be true, (used in conjunction with mood)      |
*** Credential
The Credential Evidentiality marks claims supported only by private first-person evidence.
It covers hunches, intuitions, beliefs, opinions, unsubstantiated theories, and forms of so-called *direct knowledge*.
Most schools of thought agree that Credential is one of the weakest forms of evidence.
However, for mystical and individualist schools it may be one of the strongest forms, as "conscience" or "conviction".

*** Observational
The Observational Evidentiality expresses present sensory knowledge.
It is the evidentiary form par excellance of the empricisists.

*** Recollective
The Recollective Evidentiality indicates remembered sensory knowledge.
Though generally considered weaker than the Observational, the efficacy of sense memory is essential to any empiricist philosophy. 

*** Reportive
The Reportive Evidentiality claims one or more specific individuals as knowledge sources.
Using Reportive indicates that the speaker could attribute the claim to an identifiable person or text.  

*** Conventional
The Conventional Evidentiality marks knowledge issuing from non-specific second-hand sources.
It is used for second-hand evidence that cannot be attributed to an individual.

*** Inferential
The Inferential Evidentiality attributes knowledge to a process of (possibly informal) reasoning.
Utterances marked Inferential are held to be as valid as their weakest premise or means of inference.

*** Analogical
The Analogical Evidentiality attributes knowledge to analogy, comparison, ostention, generalization, particularization, or induction.
Some philosophies consider analogical reasoning problematic, while others claim all other sources of knowledge derive from comparison in the end.

*** Non-Apprehensive
The Non-Apprehensive indicates that an absence of evidence or failure or contradiction of alternatives is the source of the knowledge.
This evidentiality would be used in statements like the following:

- There are no interstellar civilizations.
- Supernatural beings do not exist.
- No tiger is present in this room.
- A round square cannot be constructed.

*** Imaginary
The Imaginary Evidential marks statements the speaker does not know or believe to be true.
It is used in combination with irrealis moods to discuss states of affairs contrary to fact.
