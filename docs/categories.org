* Morphological Categories
Words in Free TNIL inflect for many categories. This document enumerates those categories and their values.

** Lexical items

*** Derivation
Each root has three stems and four Derivations.
Derivation selects a specific instantiation of a stem. 

| Value   | Description                     |
|---------+---------------------------------|
| Content | material, interiority, "spirit" |
| Form    | shape, exteriority, "letter"    |
| Process | activity, effort                |
| Result  | intent, purpose                 |


*** Examples

| "disease"    | disease-causing agent, pathogen    | (to express) symptoms of a disease | to sicken, to cause disease | long term outcome, prognosis                                 |

** Organizational Categories
The "Organizational set" is a powerful way of expressing how a concept is instantiated in space and time.
The organizational set is represented morphologically by a consonantal affix.
| Category       | Values | Question                                                                 |
|----------------+--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Number         |      3 | How many items in the set?                                               |
| Connectedness  |      3 | How closely are the items arranged?                                      |
| Composition    |      2 | Are the items physically similar?                                        |
| Dispostition   |      4 | What is the use/purpose/intent of the items with respect to one another? |
| Distribution   |      2 | Is the set as a whole being discussed, or each member separately?        |
| Envelope       |     12 | What part of the set (or its members) is under consideration?            |
| Quantification |      2 | Is the speaker making an existential universal claim?                    |
| Vagueness      |      2 | Is the main term being used strictly or not?                             |

Number, connectedness, and composition are tightly coupled with one another.
The categories of connectedness and composition cannot apply to Singular sets.
Consequently, for there are seven valid combinations of Number, Connectedness, Composition.

The 12 envelopes come in 2 series of six distinguished by whether they refer to space or time.
7*4*12*2*2*2=1344 values.

| homogeneous   | dual | plural |
|---------------+------+--------|
| isolated      |      | tn     |
| contiguous    |      | t      |
| fused         |      | k      |
|---------------+------+--------|
| heterogeneous | dual | plural |
|---------------+------+--------|
| isolated      |      | pf     |
| contiguous    |      | ts     |
| fused         |      | kx     |

*** Number
Number communicates how many instances of a stem are involved in the sentence's action.
| Value       | Definition                     |
|-------------+--------------------------------|
| Singular    | individual                     |
| Dual        | pair                           |
| Plural      | group                          |
*** Connectedness
Connectedness describes the spatiotemporal proximity of the items named by the stem.
| Value      | Definition         |
|------------+--------------------|
| Isolated   | separate           |
| Contiguous | adjacent, touching |
| Fused      | attached, combined |
*** Disposition
Disposition conveys the similarities of use, purpose, or condition
among members of a set.
| Name         | Definition                     |
|--------------+--------------------------------|
| Ambivalent   | unknown/irrelevant use/purpose |
| Oppositional | divided/conflicted use/purpose |
| Mutual       | shared use/purpose             |
| Synergetic   | emergent use/purpose           |
*** Composition
Composition describes the similarity or variety of a set.
| Name          | Definition        |
|---------------+-------------------|
| Homogeneous   | uniform members   |
| Heterogeneous | diverse members   |

*** Distribution
Distribution governs whether operations are applied to individual items from a set or the set itself.
Another way to think about Distribution: Conjunctive Distribution /singularizes/ the set.
| Value       | Definition               |
|-------------+--------------------------|
| Disjunctive | each instance separately |
| Conjunctive | all instances together   |

*** Envelope
Envelope identifies the spatiotemporal limits and dynamics of the set.
Note: I have Envelope scope outside of distribution.
Thus, by varying Distribution, we can refer to the beginning of the set, or the beginning of each member of the set.

| Value      | space                                    | time                     |
|------------+------------------------------------------+--------------------------|
| Partial    | part                                     | phase, moment, era of... |
| Holistic   | all                                      | (whole) duration of...   |
| Initial    | (spatial) beginning, first in a sequence | (beginning) beginning    |
| Terminal   | (spatial) end, last in a sequence        | (temporal) end           |
| Augmentive | physical/directional increase            | developing/becoming      |
| Diminutive | physical/directional decrease            | decaying/ceasing-to-be   |

*** Quantification

| Value       | Definition                      |
|-------------+---------------------------------|
| Existential | "there exists...", at least one |
| Universal   | every instance                  |

*** Vagueness
| Value     | Definition                                                       |
|-----------+------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Vague     | "something like", "what passes for"; questionable set membership |
| Non-Vague | clear set membership                                             |

** Telicity
Telicity differentiates between goal- and process-driven verbs.
| Value  | Definition                             |
|--------+----------------------------------------|
| Telic  | goal-driven, completable action        |
| Atelic | process-driven, non-completable action |
** Comparison
| Name | Definition |
|------+------------|
|      |            |
** Domain
Domain selects the context in which the word is deployed.
| Value         | Definition            |
|---------------+-----------------------|
| Material      | objective             |
| Social        | cultural/personal     |
| Metaphorical  | analogical/rhetorical |
| Philosophical | gestalt               |
*** Material
The Material Domain refers to physical reality of sensible objects.
*** Social
The Social Domain draws attention to the social or cultural dimensions of the subject of discussion.
*** Metaphorical
The Metaphorical Domain considers the analogical, rhetorical, or significative use of a word, rather than its literal definition.
*** Philosophical
The Philosophical Domain considers the full historical and philosophical range of meanings of a word.
** Discourse categories
*** Illocution
**** What does the speech *do*?
The view I want to adopt here is that all statements are performative: every utterance *does something*.
A kind of speech act that has been much analyzed by logicians is the truth claim.
Truth claims require special consideration

*** Expectation
*** Evidentials
Evidentials mark the source of information presented in an utterance.
The categories of evidence are chosen to mark clear distinctions in categories of evidence while discouraging escalation of claims.
Thus, remembered sensory knowledge is treated differently than present sensory knowledge, but all unverifiable first-person claims share a category.
All forms of evidence can be unreliable, and different thinkers disagree about which are most valid under which circumstances.
Persons can be mistaken, deceived, or motivated in their thinking, and this language must not shy away from that.

| Name             | Gloss                                   | Description                                                            |
|------------------+-----------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Credential       | "I believe/assume/posit/hypothesize..." | belief with unspecified evidence                                       |
| Observational    | "I observe..."                          | present sensory knowledge                                              |
| Recollective     | "I remember..."                         | past sensory knowledge                                                 |
| Reportive        | "Someone informed me..."                | 2nd-hand knowledge/hearsay from specific informants                    |
| Conventional     | "I know through cultural means..."      | general cultural knowledge                                             |
| Inferential      | "I conclude..."                         | result of rational process (however informal)                          |
| Analogical       | "I analogize..."                        | result of comparison, induction, extrapolation, or ostension           |
| Non-Apprehensive | "I know by negative means..."           | conclusion from absence of evidence, failure/absurdity of alternatives |
| Imaginary        | [non-claim: unreal]                     | statement not thought to be true, (used in conjunction with mood)      |

**** Credential
#+begin_quote
I think...
#+end_quote

The Credential Evidentiality marks claims supported only by private first-person evidence.
It covers hunches, intuitions, beliefs, opinions, unsubstantiated theories, and forms of so-called direct knowledge.
These diverse means of acquiring knowledge fall under a single evidentiary category so that no one can "escalate" the trustworthiness of first person information.
For example, if we hold that mystical visions carry more weight than mere opinion, an unscrupulous person could claim that their private hunch was in fact prophesy.
The purpose of evidentials is to establish the grounds upon which the conversants can come to a shared understanding of reality.
It is therefore desirable not to distinguish between evidentials which are not amenable to 2nd or 3rd person verification.
Most schools of thought agree that Credential is one of the weakest forms of evidence.
However, mystical and individualist thinkers may place it above the rest as "conscience" or "conviction", or even "revelation".

- I think they are up to some mischief.
- The gods have shown me the future.
- Nurture is as influential as nature.

**** Observational
#+begin_quote
I observe...
#+end_quote

The Observational Evidentiality expresses present sensory knowledge.
Observational is to be used when the speaker can see, hear, smell, taste, or feel the subject of conversation.
It is the evidentiary form par excellance of the empricisists.
However it is used less frequently than the Recollective because of the infrequency with which claims can be immediately verified by sense.

- The ground is soft.
- She burnt the toast.
- There are four lights.

**** Recollective
#+begin_quote
I remember...
#+end_quote

The Recollective Evidentiality indicates remembered sensory knowledge.
This evidentiality is separate from Observational because of memory's documented unreliability.
Though generally considered weaker than the Observational, the efficacy of sense memory is a presumption of any empiricist philosophy.

- They drove off in a green truck.
- He sometimes wears a hat.
- The trail begins nearby.

**** Reportive
#+begin_quote
My source informs me...
I was taught...
#+end_quote

The Reportive Evidentiality claims one or more specific individuals as knowledge sources.
Using Reportive indicates that the speaker could attribute the claim to an identifiable person or text.
(Though of course the speaker is under no obligation to divulge their informant's identity.)
Statements in the Reportive are held to be as trustworthy as the source of the information.

- Searing meat doesn't seal in the juices.
- There are billions and billions of stars.
- Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition.

**** Conventional
#+begin_quote
They say...
I read somewhere...
#+end_quote

The Conventional Evidentiality marks knowledge issuing from non-specific second-hand sources.
It is used for second-hand evidence that cannot be attributed to an individual.
This includes matters of socially determined knowledge.

- You know what they say...
- Augustine is the patron saint of brewers.
- Nevada is part of the United States.
- Carbohydrates are bad for one's health.

**** Inferential
The Inferential Evidentiality attributes knowledge to a process of (possibly informal) reasoning.
Utterances marked Inferential are held to be as valid as their most disputable premise or means of inference.
Use of Inferential suggests that the speaker could make their reasoning public.

- They must have left in a hurry.
- Only the guilty have reason to fear.

**** Analogical
#+begin_quote
I analogize...
#+end_quote

The Analogical Evidentiality attributes knowledge to analogy, comparison, ostention, generalization, particularization, or induction.
Some philosophies consider analogical reasoning problematic, while others claim all other sources of knowledge are ultimately derived from comparison.

- Other animals have first-person experiences.
- Gravity is ubiquitous.
- Primes continue without end.

**** Non-Apprehensive
#+begin_quote
Lack of evidence suggests... 
#+end_quote

The Non-Apprehensive indicates that an absence of evidence or failure or contradiction of alternatives is the source of the knowledge.
Opinions are divided on the validity of knowledge acquired through this means.

This evidentiality would be used in statements like the following:

- There are no interstellar civilizations.
- Supernatural beings do not exist.
- This house is free of tigers.
- A round square cannot be constructed.

**** Imaginary
#+begin_quote
I imagine...
#+end_quote

The Imaginary Evidential marks statements the speaker does not know or believe to be true.
It is used in combination with irrealis moods to discuss states of affairs contrary to fact.

- Water lilies fly.
- The old gods still dwell in the wild, lonely places.
- All swans are white.
- If I were a rich man...
