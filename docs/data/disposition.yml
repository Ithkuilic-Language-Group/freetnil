name: disposition
abbrev: dsp
brief: (dis)similarity of function and manner 
full: |
  Disposition indicates the variety of functions and manners of an
  organizational collection. Specifically whether the elements

  1. do one thing, or many things,
  2. whether they do this in one way, or many ways.

  | Disposition  | do one thing | do many things |
  |--------------|--------------|----------------|
  | in one way   | Dirigent     | Divergent      |
  | in many ways | Convergent   | Frangent       |

  For instance, a collection of cutting tools might include a scalpel,
  a hand-saw, a buzz-saw, a laser, and a high pressure water
  jet. These things all do one thing, but they accomplish it in many
  ways. On the other hand, a collection of simple hand tools might do
  many things, but accomplish these diverse tasks in more or less the
  same way (by providing mechanical advantage, etc).
