#+title: Discourse, Evidence, Illocution
* The Structure of Discursive Categories
This language will systematically distinguish between discourse and content categories.
Content categories apply to the subject matter of a conversation, while Discourse categories apply to the conversants.
These categories of Sanction, Validation, and Illocution are , as [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Ithkuil/comments/9fi82g/a_list_of_ideas_for_the_forthcoming_ithkuilic/e5ysq03/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x][la_menli]] and others have suggested, poorly understood and perhaps poorly structured.
We will review these categories in Ithkuil '11 and other conlangs.

* Improving the situation
Discourse categories should answer a number of questions.

** What does the speech *do*? (Illocution)
The view I want to adopt here is that all statements are performative: every utterance *does something*.
A kind of speech act that has been much analyzed by logicians is the truth claim.
Truth claims require special consideration

** Purpose: What kind of response is expected of the addressee?
Currently under consideration: a three-fold structure, roughly thought, speech, action.

| Name       |         |               | Description                                     |
|------------+---------+---------------+-------------------------------------------------|
| Cognitive  | thought | declarative   | consider/contemplate what is being said         |
| Discursive | speech  | interrogative | comment, answer a question, refute a claim, etc |
| Motive     | action  | imperative    | undertake some other kind of action             |

These categories are similar to the sentence purposes: declarative, interrogative, and imperative.
However they have a broader application.
For example, though Discursive roughly corresponds to Interrogative, it also conveys something like "refutability" from Ithkuil's Sanction.
To mark an expression with the Discursive is to invite one's audience to comment on its meaning and veracity.
There's a whole bunch of undigested philosophy here, but I'll try to summarize.
There are many views on what truth is and how it may be ascertained.
Each view has its own criteria of judging truth claims, and therefore cannot endorse any other claims but its own.
However, we can do something like a fixed point operation to find a view that is indifferent to the diversity of opinions.



** What is the source of the information?
