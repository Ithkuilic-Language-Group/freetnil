#+title: Discourse, Evidence, Illocution
* The Structure of Discursive Categories
This language will systematically distinguish between discourse and content categories.
Content categories apply to the subject matter of a conversation, while Discourse categories apply to the conversants.
These categories of Sanction, Validation, and Illocution are , as [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Ithkuil/comments/9fi82g/a_list_of_ideas_for_the_forthcoming_ithkuilic/e5ysq03/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x][la_menli]] and others have suggested, poorly understood and perhaps poorly structured.
We will review these categories in Ithkuil '11 and other conlangs.

* Improving the situation
Discourse categories should answer a number of questions.

** What does the speech *do*? (Illocution)
The view I want to adopt here is that all statements are performative: every utterance *does something*.
A kind of speech act that has been much analyzed by logicians is the truth claim.
Truth claims require special consideration

** What kind of response is expected?
Currently under consideration: a three-fold structure, roughly thought, word, action.
| Name       | Description                                                        |
|------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cognitive  | consider/contemplate what is being said                            |
| Responsive | make a speech act: answer a question, refute a claim, comment, etc |
| Motive     | undertake some other kind of action                                |

** What is the source of the information?

| Name          | Gloss                              | Description                                         |
|---------------+------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------|
| Observational | "I observe..."                     | present sensory knowledge                           |
| Mnemonic      | "I remember..."                    | past sensory knowledge                              |
| Rational      | "I reason..."                      | conclusion of rational process (however informal)   |
| Analogical    | "I analogize..."                   | conclusion of comparison, induction, or ostension   |
| Reportive     | "I hear..."                        | 2nd-hand knowledge/hearsay from specific informants |
| Conventional  | "I know through cultural means..." | general cultural knowledge                          |

** Are there any relevant presuppositions (Mood)
