title: RFC: Discourse as a tree
author: porpoiseless

## Problem

Conversation is messy and difficult to keep track of. It is easy to mistake someone's offhand remark for an attempt at topic change.

## Duration

Time is an illusion. Language is eternal.

## Current State

Draft.

## Proposers

## Detail

Let's provide the most sophisticated and usable discourse marking system
possible.

## Proposal

In formal speech, utterances are marked for the conversational role they
serve. This somewhat resembles Ithkuil's Sanction, but it operates in a rigorous
way and presupposes less about the contents of discourse.

[Brief aside on effect: it seems to me that effect is ambiguous. Is it the proposition expressed in the sentence, the marked word, or that word's referent that has the positive/negative/neutral effect?]

It would be more useful to express one's stance on the judgments involved in a preceding or following statement.

How does Expectation work with this?

- Imagine being in a meeting and asking someone to pass a glass of water.
- Or being told to "think about where we should have lunch" while doing something else.
- Pretty much any scenario where the topic of discourse need not mirror what is
going on.

Speech- and other acts will form a tree-like shape. (Non-speech acts, and
thoughts, can be considered parts of language that are never marked
linguistically--but they provide the context that gives language meaning!)

List of markers:

- new topic,
- tangent,
- point in favor,
- point against,
- neutral/conflicted point,
- foundational critique/rejection of underlying premise,
- providing a different perspective/paradigm shift,
- example/narrowing down/specific case or sub issue
- abstraction/generalization/governing rule

There are probably type restrictions here too--point in favor/point
against really only works with propositions/assertions.

We also need tree operations, namely:

- return to parent topic
- return to immediately preceding child topic of parent,
- find/create new child topic
